# Dermatology app
Many people tend to neglect their skin problems because they perceive them as unimportant, thinking that they will pass over time by itself, or by using a product that most of the time is not suitable for treating specific conditions. Therefore, they can have further problems that may appear in the future. Since nowadays technology plays a huge role in our lives, and almost everything is digitalized, in order to solve this problem, we have thought to develop an app that aims to facilitate the interaction of patients with dermatologist specialists. </br></br>
This app will help people communicate directly to specialists and send their skin images. A dermatologist can easily diagnose a skin problem through an image, that is why this app will save time for patients. The user can fill out a form and attach the skin photo and other health information that might be needed by the doctor, such as past medical records. By having access to these files, the doctor avoids prescribing medication that can contain ingredients, which may cause an allergic reaction in the patient. After the doctor gives the diagnosis, he can contact the patient and give a prescription which is in a printable version. </br></br>
Furthermore, if the condition is serious, the patient also has the possibility to schedule appointments with the dermatologist/clinic of his choice. The app will also support other activities like payment, searching skin information, calling and sending messages, skin history, daily skincare tips, etc. </br></br>
The patients, doctors, as well as clinics should profit from this system, which is designed to make their life easier by arranging and eliminating unnecessary human errors from their daily activities. Diagnosing skin issues and preserving skin health has never been easier thanks to sophisticated technology and artificial intelligence. In no time, you will be able to connect with licensed dermatologists and put your anxieties to rest.
