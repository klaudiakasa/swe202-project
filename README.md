# Dermatology app
Many people tend to neglect their skin problems because they (perceive it as unimportant, contemplate that it will pass by time, or by using product which most of the time are not suitable for treating specific conditions) think it will pass by itself or use ..., therefore they can have further problem that may appear in the future. Since now days technology plays a huge role in our lives, and almost everything is digitalized, in order to solve this problem, we have thought to develop an app which aims to facilitate the interaction of patients with dermatologist specialists. </br>
This app will help people communicate directly to specialists and send their skin image. Dermatologist can easily diagnose the skin problem through an image, that is why this app will save time to patients. The user can fill a form to attach the skin photo and other health information that might be needed for the doctor, such as past medical records. By having access to these files, the doctor avoids prescribing medication that can contain ingredients, which may cause an allergic reaction to the patient. After the doctor gives the diagnose, he can contact the patient and give prescription which is printable version. </br>
Furthermore, if the condition is serious, the patient also has the possibility to schedule appointments with the dermatologist/clinic of his choice. The app will also support other activities like payment, searching skin information, calling and sending messages, skin history, daily skincare tips etc. </br>
The patients, doctors, as well as the clinics should profit from this system, which is designed to make their life easier by arranging and eliminating unnecessary human errors from their daily activities. Diagnosing skin issues and preserving skin health has never been easier thanks to sophisticated technology and artificial intelligence. In no time, you will be able to connect with licensed dermatologists and put your anxieties to rest.
